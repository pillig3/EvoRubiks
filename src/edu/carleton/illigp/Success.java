/** 
 * TLDR;
 * mandatory args = int[] config, ArrayList<Integer> testSolution
 * optional args = ArrayList<Integer> idealSolution
 * returns = int success (representing a percentage [0,100])
 * 
 * FULL DESCRIPTION;
 * Given a Rubik's Cube configuration, and the solution proposed by our EA, this class 
 * will allow us to measure the success of our EA. Success_old will be measured by comparing
 * our solution to an upper bound, baseline, and lower bound. If we already know the ideal 
 * solution for that configuration, this gives us a clear upper bound--if the proposed 
 * solution is identical to the ideal solution, we have succeeded 100%. Otherwise, we 
 * must check if the solution actually solves the given configuration at all--if it does,
 * then we have succeeded in reaching our baseline, and success will be measured more 
 * specifically by comparing the number of moves in our solution to the number of moves in 
 * the ideal solution.  Finally, if the Rubik's cube is not solved when our solution is 
 * applied to it, we will request its Rubikâ€™s Completion Ratio (RCR = correctPieces / totalPieces)
 * and compare this ratio to the RCR of a randomly generated solution of the same length 
 * as our EA's solution--our EA can only be considered mildly successful if the RCR of our 
 * EA solution is greater than that of the random solution, although it would be preferable 
 * that the our EA's RCR were closer to 1 than to the random solution's RCR.
