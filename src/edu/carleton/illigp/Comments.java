/** 
 * QUESTIONS/COMMENTS/CONCERNS
 *
 * FROM MAK:
 * Currently, genomes are being represented as int[] in both Main.java & Solution.java,
 * did you choose to do this instead of an ArrayList<Integer> for a reason?  I used 
 * ArrayList<Integer> in Success.java since I thought the genomes weren't of a fixed length 
 * so I assumed ArrayLists would be easier to add/remove things from.  If you did this bc 
 * of memory/some other good reason, lmk and I'll change my class to take int[].
